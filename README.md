This is a python script for accessing https://rapidapi.com/ortegalex/api/horse-racing-usa. 

Not really sure about the quality of this Api. It does not appear to be thorough. It seems to be missing some race tracks. In any event, it was just a test app to see what is involved in retrieving this data.

Offers 3 main apis to access:
1) get racecard info - the various racecards for various race tracks around the USA.
2) get finishedRace info - gets info about the races that have been run. 
3) get raceResult info - gets details about the race Result for a specific race Id.
